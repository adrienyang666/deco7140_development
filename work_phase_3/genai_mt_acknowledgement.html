                    <p>
                        I acknowledge that I have used Generative AI tools (such
                        as ChatGPT) during the design process, specifically for
                        idea generation, phrasing, and layout review. I did not
                        submit any content generated by AI tools without review
                        or editing. No machine translation tools were used.

                    <p>
                        GenAI tools helped me explore alternative ways to
                        express design ideas and understand how to apply WCAG
                        principles. I used ChatGPT to review accessibility
                        strategies, improve annotation clarity, and structure
                        justification sections. I maintained full control over
                        the creative and editorial process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using AI tools allowed me to focus more on visual
                        consistency and ethical storytelling. However, I
                        verified all technical suggestions manually and ensured
                        alignment with course expectations and values.

                        I affirm that this submission complies with UQ‚Äôs
                        academic integrity policy. Where I used generative tools
                        to support the design process, I documented and
                        critically reviewed their contribution. I understand
                        that these tools must not substitute for original
                        thought or informed ethical judgment.

                        <p>
                            I approached generative AI as a design assistant ‚Äî
                            helpful in speeding up layout logic and visual
                            mockups, but always guided by my own creative
                            intent. Its use was strategic and limited to areas
                            where it could enhance clarity or efficiency.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            All outputs were reviewed and restructured by me. I
                            rejected results that didn‚Äôt meet accessibility
                            standards or user-centered goals. This kept my
                            design process ethical, intentional, and
                            user-focused.
