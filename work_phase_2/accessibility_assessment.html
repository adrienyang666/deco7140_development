                    <p>
                        This assessment identifies key accessibility
                        considerations for the proposed website, using the WCAG
                        2.2 Level AA guidelines. The aim is to ensure the
                        website is inclusive, usable, and accessible to all
                        users, including those with visual, auditory, cognitive,
                        and physical impairments.

                    <h3>Key Accessibility Features</h3>
                    <ul>

                            <strong>High Contrast & Readable Fonts:</strong> All
                            text uses accessible contrast ratios and legible,
                            sans-serif fonts to support users with low vision.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Scalable Text:</strong> Font sizes are
                            responsive and allow user zooming without breaking
                            layout.
                        </li>

                            alternative text for screen readers.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Keyboard Navigation:</strong> Interactive
                            elements such as flip cards and buttons are fully
                            navigable via keyboard (e.g. tab/enter keys).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Multilingual Support:</strong> Language
                            toggle allows users to access recipe content in
                            different languages (e.g., English and Spanish).
                        </li>

                            <strong>Transcripts and Captions:</strong> All audio

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Clear Layout:</strong> Content is structured
                            with logical headings, short paragraphs, and clear
                            labels to reduce cognitive load.

                    <h3>Connection to User Research</h3>
                    <p>
                        Accessibility features directly respond to the needs of
                        the user personas. For example, Nai Nai Li benefits from
                        large fonts and audio content. Emilia, an ESL user,
                        benefits from simplified layout and language toggling.
                        Aiden’s event content will be made accessible with
                        visual contrast and alternative text for promotional
                        graphics.
