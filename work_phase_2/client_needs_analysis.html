                <h3>About Us</h3>
                <p>
                    We are a non-profit organisation dedicated to fostering
                    <span class="interactive-highlight" data-card="Value 1">
                        social cohesion</span
                    >
                    by empowering diverse communities to share their stories,
                    connect with others, and access resources that enhance their
                    visibility and influence. Our mission is to strengthen
                    societal bonds by creating platforms that celebrate and
                    support the unique identities of communities across
                    Australia.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This brief has been prepared for the internal design teams
                    at Connect Communities Initiative (CCI). Each design team is
                    tasked with developing individual concepts and prototypes
                    for dynamic websites that align with CCI’s mission and
                    vision. Our mission is to strengthen societal bonds by
                    creating platforms that celebrate and support the unique
                    identities of communities across Australia.
                </p>
                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    We are commissioning the development of dynamic,
                    user-friendly websites that represent and support different
                    communities. Each website should serve as a central hub
                    where community members can share resources, highlight
                    events, and foster meaningful connections. The websites must
                    not include any form of commercial activity, such as
                    advertising or selling products. However, it is acceptable
                    to promote resources, events, or services that are directly
                    beneficial to the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The websites must be accessible, mobile-friendly, and
                    reflect the diverse needs of the selected community focus
                    area while adhering to our mission of inclusivity,
                    accessibility, and ethical design. Each website should also
                    celebrate the unique characteristics of its chosen community
                    and support meaningful interaction and engagement.
                </p>
                <h3>Community Focus Areas</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cultural and Heritage Communities</li>

                    <li>Wellness and Mental Health Communities</li>
                    <li>Social and Environmental Advocacy Communities</li>

                <h3>Additional Information</h3>
                <p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p>
                <p>Each website must serve two key groups:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Community Members: Individuals within the selected
                        community who seek representation, resources, and
                        connection.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        General Audience: Broader society, who can use the
                        website to learn about the community and its
                        contributions.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Accessibility must be prioritised to ensure seamless
                    interaction for all users, including those relying on
                    assistive technologies.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Project Goals</strong></p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Represent and celebrate the identity of the chosen
                        community, recognising and representing the diversity
                        within the community rather than relying on stereotypes.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provide clear, accessible information and resources to
                        users.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Foster meaningful connections and support within the
                        community.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensure ethical, inclusive, and culturally sensitive
                        design principles are upheld.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    Based on the client brief provided by Connect Communities
                    Initiative (CCI), their primary goal is to foster social
                    cohesion and celebrate the identities of diverse
                    communities. The website must reflect values such as
                    inclusivity, accessibility, and cultural sensitivity.
                    Therefore, the design must avoid stereotypes, enable users
                    to access relevant resources, and encourage active
                    participation through storytelling and community-driven
                    content.

                    The following analysis outlines the key values of the client
                    (CCI), the corresponding needs of the target users, and
                    suggested website features to address those needs. These
                    elements are essential to create a website that is
                    inclusive, ethical, and aligned with the community’s
                    identity.
