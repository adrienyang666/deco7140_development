                <p>
                    This ethics analysis evaluates the website design through
                    the lens of the Australian Computer Society (ACS) Code of
                    Ethics. It focuses on ensuring that the design respects user
                    dignity, protects cultural integrity, promotes inclusivity,
                    and acknowledges the responsible use of AI tools.

                    <p>
                        The website supports cultural representation by enabling
                        users from different backgrounds to share traditional
                        recipes. Care is taken to avoid stereotypes and
                        misrepresentation of food practices. Recipe submissions
                        are community-moderated to ensure respectful content.
