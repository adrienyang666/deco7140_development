                    <h3>1. Tools Used</h3>
                    <p>
                        I used Generative AI (ChatGPT) to support content
                        generation for the five project pages in Work Phase 2.
                        AI was used to simulate user interviews, draft content
                        structures, check grammar, and suggest phrasing. I also
                        used DeepL and Google Translate to assist in translating
                        certain sections for bilingual drafts.

                    <h3>2. Modification and Critical Engagement</h3>
                    <p>
                        All AI-generated or translated content was carefully
                        reviewed, edited, and restructured by me. I ensured that
                        outputs aligned with the assignment requirements and
                        reflected my own design decisions and understanding. No
                        AI content was used “as-is” without thoughtful
                        modification.

                    <h3>3. Benefits</h3>
                    <p>
                        These tools helped me save time, overcome language
                        barriers, and explore more precise ways to express
                        ideas. They were especially helpful when brainstorming
                        user personas, writing accessible descriptions, and
                        generating ethical language.

                    <h3>4. Risks and Ethical Reflection</h3>
                    <p>
                        I am aware that AI-generated content can contain bias,
                        inaccuracies, or generic ideas. Relying too much on
                        these tools without critical thinking could result in
                        unoriginal work or academic integrity issues. I used
                        them responsibly, with proper editing and reflection.

                    <p>
                        This page serves as a full declaration of how I used
                        GenAI and MT tools. I confirm that I complied with the
                        course’s academic integrity guidelines and did not use
                        any AI tools for unauthorised assistance or plagiarism.
