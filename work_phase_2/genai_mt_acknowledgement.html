                <p>
                    This assessment involved creating a multi-page user research
                    and analysis website for the Food and Culinary Communities
                    project. I used ChatGPT to assist in generating interview
                    prompts and responses, summarising user insights into user
                    stories, and producing HTML and CSS snippets. Grammarly was
                    also used to refine the grammar of written reflections.

                        I checked the assessment task sheet and the ECP to
                        confirm that the use of GenAI tools was permitted for
                        user research and design support. I ensured all
                        generated content was critically reviewed and modified.

                        I chose ChatGPT for its conversational capabilities and
                        idea generation, and Grammarly for proofreading. These
                        tools supported my design thinking while allowing space
                        for personal input and learning.

                <h3>Reflection</h3>
                <p>
                    Using GenAI tools helped accelerate the ideation phase and
                    gave me new ways to think about diverse user needs. However,
                    I encountered limitations such as generic or biased content,
                    which required multiple iterations and critical engagement.
                    Through this process, I learned to refine prompts and
                    interpret responses rather than accept outputs at face
                    value. Next time, I will plan more time for prompt testing
                    and explore multiple tools to triangulate better insights.
                    Reviewing and revising AI outputs improved my confidence in
                    both content generation and ethical web design.

                <h3>Integrity Statement</h3>
                <p>
                    I used GenAI tools as a supplement to my own design and
                    research efforts. All AI-generated content was carefully
                    reviewed, edited, and integrated to align with academic
                    expectations. This acknowledgement ensures transparency and
                    supports my learning, while maintaining the integrity of
                    this assessment task.
